# treeExpressions



# Overview
A binary expression tree is a specific kind of a binary tree used to represent expressions. Two common types of expressions that a binary expression tree can represent are algebraic and boolean. These trees can represent expressions that contain both unary and binary operators. Each node of a binary tree, and hence of a binary expression tree, has zero, one, or two children. This restricted structure simplifies the processing of expression trees.

Algebraic expression tree made on Data Structure discipline in 2018.

## 1. What this project do? 

Basically, you need put on an aritmethic expression and variables values to receice a result. See the readme for more infomations about your use.

###### Data structures required

- Linked list;
- Stack;
- Binary Tree;


## 2. How to use? 

- Import this project on Java Eclipse Project, maybe you need add a project file e the classpath;
- Put in an expression with spaces between characters
- For each binary operation, insert the pair "()", for example: A + B, you must write ( A + B )
- You can write variables composites as "force", "preasure" and other. Example: ( electricCurrent * potential )
- Try to write big expressions like   ( A + ( 18 – ( value – ( D –  B ) ) ) ) :D
- Compatible with floating numbers

- Thank you for download, read, and check our expression tree (a application of all we learned on data structures discipline!)
We hope be helpfull!
