# treeExpressions
Expression tree made on Data Structure discipline in 2018. There're many structures used like stacks, linkedlist. Basically, you need put on an aritmethic expression and variables values to receice a result. See the readme for more infomations about your use.

- Java Eclipse Project, maybe you need add a project file e the classpath
- Put in an expression with spaces between characters
- For each binary operation, insert the pair "()", for example: A + B, you must write ( A + B )
- You can write variables composites as "force", "preasure" and other. Example: ( electricCurrent * potential )
- You would write big expressions like   ( A + ( 18 – ( value – ( D –  B ) ) ) )
- Compatible with floating numbers

- Thank you for download, read, and check our expression tree (a application of all we learned on data structures discipline!)
We hope be helpfull!
